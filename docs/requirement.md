## Obtaining the Magic Ingredients

### Tesseract OCR

Before you dive into the mystical world of OCR, you need to conjure Tesseract OCR into your realm. It's like getting your very own Oracle.

1. **Download**: Visit the [Tesseract OCR Download Page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and grab the executable that matches your operating system.

2. **Set the Path**: Add the path to Tesseract executable (the folder containing `tesseract.exe`) to your system's environment variables. This lets your spells reach Tesseract from anywhere.

### Poppler for Windows

To handle enchanted PDFs, you need Poppler for Windows. It's like getting a magical key to unlock the secrets of PDF documents.

1. **Download**: Go to the [Poppler for Windows Website](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/) and download the version that suits your system.

2. **Install**: Extract the downloaded file and place it in a safe and magical location on your system.

3. **Poppler Path**: Remember the location where you placed Poppler? You'll need to use that path later when you're casting your PDF spells.

## You're Ready to Cast Spells!

With the required libraries and mystical tools in your grasp, you're ready to weave your incantations and unveil the hidden words within images and documents.

Remember, the magic lies in your code, but these requirements and tools are your trusty allies on your OCR quest. May your text be extracted flawlessly, and your documents reveal their secrets!
